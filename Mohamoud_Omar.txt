My name is Mohamoud Omar Mohamoud , i was born in Hargeisa on may 27th 2000.
i was raised in Somaliland so i dont want to live in any other country
my favourite movie is Trasnformers all 3 parties 
one interesting fact about me is i am a seaman(first rank in the coast guard/navy) in Somaliland Coast Guard/Navy.
one of the many things i do is i travell to the coast often and spend almost 6 days on water which pretty rough sometimes.
